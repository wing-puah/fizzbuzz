# Javascript & programming concepts
This repo contains a list of programs that I created to understand the principles of programming and the concepts of Javascript. These programs are generated from various places like hackerrank and common interview questions.

All the programs here are developed with test-driven development and object oriented concepts in mind.

__Coming soon__

### Object-oriented programming
__Encapsulation__

__Abstraction__

__Inheritance__

__Polymorphism__

### Functional programming
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data —  _Wikipedia_

__Pure function__

Functional programming revolves around the concept of writing __pure functions__. A pure function has the following behaviors:

- It returns the same results if given the same arguments.
- It does not cause any observable side effects, which means it will not modify the state variable value(s) outside its local environment.


__Immutability__
An immutable data means that the state does not change after it's created. Instead of changing the values of an immutable object, a new object is created with the new value.
